                <p>Hey everybody, my name is Sam, I'm 25, and I was born and raised right outside of Philadelphia. I've always had an interest in computers and mathematics and figured 
                    I should start putting those skills to use in a professional setting.</p>

                <p>My first love was always music, I started producing music on my computer at the age of 17 and have amassed a decent following (though I won't be selling out shows any time soon). I have been fortunate enough
                    to have performed in several cities with some of my best friends, and to me that's plenty. In addition to that in the past year I have picked up video editing and made a few short videos for a local food bank, as well as some personal projects. Generally I do get a kick out of
                    learning a new software and finding all of the cool tricks I can use to up my game.
